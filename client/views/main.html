                The word ‘entente’ (from the French entente) means ‘an alliance of parties to such an understanding.’  The goal of this application is to connect like-minded users on important social and environmental issues by geographical region.  Connection is important, and in this world of rapid political change and uncertainty, it is comforting to know that you are not alone in your concerns, efforts and intentions.
            </p>

            <p>
              To start, feel free to explore Entente by geographical region or environmental/social concern.  Upon signing up as a user (or logging in as a returning user), you will be directed to your profile page, where you can rate your level of concern for specific issues with a slider (scale of 1 to 10).  Then check out those in your area and elsewhere in the world who share your concerns and interests, and connect via our chat feature.
