                The word ‘entente’ (from the French entente) means ‘an alliance of parties to such an understanding.’  The goal of this application is to connect like-minded users on important social and environmental issues by geographical region.  Connection is important, and in this world of rapid political change and uncertainty, it is comforting to know that you are not alone in your concerns, efforts and intentions.
